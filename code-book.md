# Getting and Cleaning Data Project Code Book

## Data Description:
Data is from UCI HAR Dataset and provides the following informaiton:

This dataset provide the following variables for each activity:
  1. *subject* - ID of participant
  2. *activity* - ID of activity type
  3. Mean and standart deviation for the following features (other values are presented in initial dataset, but for this reasearch only these parameters were used)
      * tBodyAcc-XYZ
      * tGravityAcc-XYZ
      * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      * tBodyGyro-XYZ
      * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
      * tBodyAccMag
      * tGravityAccMag
      * tBodyAccJerkMag
      * tBodyGyroMag
      * tBodyGyroJerkMag
      * fBodyAcc-XYZ
      * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
      * fBodyGyro-XYZ
      * fBodyAccMag
      * fBodyAccJerkMag
      * fBodyGyroMag

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

=============================================

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

*mean(): Mean value
*std(): Standard deviation
*mad(): Median absolute deviation 
*max(): Largest value in array
*min(): Smallest value in array
*sma(): Signal magnitude area
*energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
*iqr(): Interquartile range 
*entropy(): Signal entropy
*arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
*correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
*maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
*meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
*skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
*kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
*bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
*angle(): Angle between to vectors.
